# **📊 Introduction to Data Analysis with Python**

This repository follows the online course **Data Analysis with Python**, lectured by the **freeCodeCamp** organization. In this course, five practical projects introduce the basics of analyzing data with Python. These projects cover simple statistical analysis, data manipulation with pandas, cleaning techniques, visualizations, and graphics.

Each folder in this repository contains the base code provided by the organization, along with the developed solutions for the specific challenges in the project. The individual folders also have a `README` file describing the context of the problem and the steps needed to implement a solution. Below is a table listing the name and status of each of the five projects.

| Project Name | Status |
| --- | :---: |
| Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator | ✔️ |
| Demographic Data Analyzer | ✔️ |
| Medical Data Visualizer | ✔️ | 
| Page View Time Series Visualizer | ✔️ |
| Sea Level Predictor | ⌛ |
